				Welcome to this digital domain of mine,
				built and maintained by my occasional
				sleep deprivation and procrastination.
				The design and features of this page
				are a work in progress.<br>

				* Orpheus<br>
				<br>
				Named after the character in greek myth,
				Orpheus is any and all storage devices
				that contain my MP3 files. All of them are sorted
				by their meanings, from either the lyrics, context
				or vibes alone.<br>
				<br>
				The 22 folders present are all major arcana
				tarot cards. File names are 8 characters or shorter
				due to the device's small display, such that it
				can only fit up to that many characters. Good luck figuring them out!<br>
				<br>
				The files come tagged with name, artist, album,
				genre, track number and disc number. I mostly use
				<a href='https://rateyourmusic.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>rateyourmusic.com</a>
				and <a href='https://www.submithub.com/whats-my-genre' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>submithub.com</a> to figure out
				the genre.<br>
				<br>
